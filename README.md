### `This is a project I built over approximately 10 hours for falmouthlaunchpad as a technical test.`

The brief for this project was as a weather tracking application for a given list of surfing locations. I used the openweather API to retrieve the current wind-speed & temperature for a given latitude/longitude and style a circular marker on my leaflet map to indicate the results. I allowed the user to select a skill level which will style the elements differently for different ranges of wind-speed.
